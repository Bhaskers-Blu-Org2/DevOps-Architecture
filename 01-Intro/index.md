Chapter 1 – Introduction
========================

The purpose of this book is to equip .Net development teams with a complete
roadmap to a high-performing DevOps process using Microsoft technologies. This
book is not about any one product or tool. It is not about one particular
practice or method. This book is about bringing all the tools and frameworks
Microsoft and the industry has to offer into the fold. This book is about
applying the relevant practices and methods in an effective way in order to
achieve a software delivery process that is second-to-none. If you lead a
software team and want to deliver and operate software like companies you’ve
only read about, read on.

Principles
----------

I will start with principles, because any technical work that we do must be
guided by principles if others are to align with our work. Without guiding
principles, a team cannot become a team. The team will have no culture, and each
team member will be tugging in different directions.
